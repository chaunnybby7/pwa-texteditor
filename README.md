# PWA Text Editor
```
The goal of this project is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. 

The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. 


It will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. 

The application will also function offline.

## Description

To build this text editor, I have started with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. There will be a package called `idb`, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. 

It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
